silenttrust
===========

Silent Trust video game built in Unity 3D and tested on Win7 and Ubuntu 12.04. 

This is a 2-player game.
Player 2 uses either an Xbox controller or the keyboard to move the game player through the 3D world while wearing headphones.
Player 1 uses the visuals and the mouse to send either controller vibrations or audio input to direct Player 2 to their destination.
The end goal is to provide a game that cuts off a sense (or two). Player 1 cannot hear the game environment. Player 2 can see the environment. And neither player is supposed to speak to each other.
So, in other words, you must trust each other, in a world where communication has gone silent.

Project conceived and started at Global Game Jam 2014 at the UMBC site with a team of 6.
Personally continued development after GGJ.
